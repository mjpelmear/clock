# clock
This is a testing utility for golang apps that need to have unit tests involving time.Now(), time.Sleep(), etc.
It is based on https://github.com/smartystreets/clock, but includes some significant deviations from that design.

# Supported Functions

- time.Now()
- time.Sleep()
- time.TimeSince()
